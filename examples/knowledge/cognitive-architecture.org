* Introduction

This is a sample knowledge base demonstrating Emacogs integration with org-mode.

* Cognitive Architectures

** OpenCog

OpenCog is a open-source artificial general intelligence framework.

*** AtomSpace

The AtomSpace is a hypergraph database for knowledge representation.

*** PLN

Probabilistic Logic Networks provide uncertain reasoning capabilities.

** SOAR

SOAR is a cognitive architecture for developing systems that exhibit intelligent behavior.

** ACT-R

ACT-R is a cognitive architecture focusing on modeling human cognition.

* Artificial Intelligence

** Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI focused on learning from data.

*** Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled training data.

*** Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.

*** Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning learns through trial and error with rewards.

** Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing enables computers to understand human language.

** Computer Vision

Computer Vision enables machines to interpret visual information.

* Neuro-Symbolic AI

Neuro-symbolic AI combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning.

** Benefits
