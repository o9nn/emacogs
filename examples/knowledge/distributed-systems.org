* Distributed Systems

** Core Concepts

*** Concurrency

Multiple processes executing simultaneously.

*** Parallelism

Multiple computations happening at the same time.

*** Distribution

Computation spread across multiple nodes.

** Communication Patterns

*** Message Passing

Processes communicate by sending messages.

**** Synchronous

Sender waits for receiver acknowledgment.

**** Asynchronous

Sender continues without waiting.

*** Shared Memory

Processes share memory space.

*** Channels

CSP-style communication channels.

** Consistency Models

*** Strong Consistency

All nodes see the same data at the same time.

*** Eventual Consistency

All nodes will eventually see the same data.

*** Causal Consistency

Causally related operations are seen in order.

** Fault Tolerance

*** Replication

Data is replicated across multiple nodes.

*** Consensus

Nodes agree on shared state.

**** Paxos

Classic consensus algorithm.

**** Raft

Understandable consensus algorithm.

** Distributed Cognitive Systems

*** Cognitive Load Distribution

Distribute cognitive processing across nodes.

*** Knowledge Sharing

Share knowledge between cognitive nodes.

*** Collaborative Reasoning

Multiple nodes reason collaboratively.

* Inferno OS Concepts

** Limbo Language

Limbo is the programming language of Inferno OS.

*** Features

- Type safety
- Garbage collection
- Channels for communication
- Module system
- Network transparency

*** Communication

Channels provide CSP-style message passing.

*** Concurrency

Lightweight threads called "processes".

** Distributed Namespace

All resources accessible through unified namespace.

** Network Protocol (Styx)

Protocol for distributed resource access.
