* Agent Systems

** Definition

An agent is an autonomous entity that observes and acts upon an environment.

** Types of Agents

*** Reactive Agents

Reactive agents respond directly to environmental stimuli.

*** Deliberative Agents

Deliberative agents use internal models for planning.

*** Hybrid Agents

Hybrid agents combine reactive and deliberative approaches.

** Multi-Agent Systems

*** Coordination

Agents coordinate to achieve common goals.

*** Communication

Agents exchange information through messages.

*** Negotiation

Agents negotiate to resolve conflicts.

** Agent Architectures

*** BDI Architecture

Belief-Desire-Intention architecture models agent reasoning.

**** Beliefs

Beliefs represent the agent's knowledge about the world.

**** Desires

Desires represent the agent's goals.

**** Intentions

Intentions represent committed plans.

*** Subsumption Architecture

Layered architecture for reactive agents.

** Agent Learning

*** Reinforcement Learning

Agents learn optimal policies through rewards.

*** Imitation Learning

Agents learn by observing other agents.

*** Transfer Learning

Agents transfer knowledge between tasks.
